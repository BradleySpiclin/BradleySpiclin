  <summary><h3>🌐 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I’ve always had a keen interest in computer programs ever since I spent countless hours playing classic video games on an Apple IIe (frogger, Piccadilly Pair and Carmen Sandiego – just to name a few). A developer friend of mine suggested that if I wanted to get into coding then perhaps building some video games might be a good place to start. I took this advice and completed some courses using Unreal Engine and developed a very basic (I was proud at the time!) maze game. I continued to invest in learning game development until I began to realize that I really loved reading and writing code and decided to pursue a career in Software Development.<br /><br />My first introduction to coding was at TAFE where I was thrown straight into C# Windows console and form applications where I gained many of the fundamental skills I possess today. I’m currently in my final year of University and always looking to develop my technical skills and knowledge further.
